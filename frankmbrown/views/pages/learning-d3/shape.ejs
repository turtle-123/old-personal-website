  Visualizations can be represented by discrete graphical marks such as symbols, arcs, lines, and areas. While the rectangles of a bar chart may sometimes be simple, other shapes are complex, such as rounded annular sectors and Catmullâ€“Rom splines. The d3-shape module provides a variety of shape generators for your convenience.

As with other aspects of D3, these shapes are driven by data: each shape generator exposes accessors that control how the input data are mapped to a visual representation. For example, you might define a line generator for a time series by scaling fields of your data to fit the chart:
