  <p>
    Dispatching is a low-level interaction mechanism that allows you to register named callbacks and then call them with arbitrary arguments. A variety of D3 interaction components, such as d3-drag, use dispatch to emit events to listeners. Think of this as EventTarget except every listener has a well-defined name so itâ€™s easy to remove or replace them.
