An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one



  An h2 header
  ------------
  
  Here's a numbered list:
  
    1. first item
    2. second item
    3. third item
  
  Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
  from the left side). Here's a code sample:
  
      # Let me re-iterate ...
      for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
  
  As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
  indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:
  
  ~~~
  define foobar() {
      print "Welcome to flavor country!";
  }
  ~~~
  
  (which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
  delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:
