### About Creating A Poll
- Each poll question type should have a function `getPoll[TYPE]CreatePollHTML` that returns an element that can be appended to an empty `div[data-edit-poll-question]`
- Each Poll Question Should have a getPollAudioInput that accepts a div and can get the audio input from there
